# compound_AI
Traditional AI is task-focused and single-purpose, while Compound AI is multi-faceted, collaborative, and adaptable.
Compound AI is particularly useful in Agentic AI, where multiple agents work together dynamically to handle complex and ever-changing environments.

- **Traditional AI**: Single task (e.g., calculator).  
- **Compound AI**: Multiple systems for one goal (e.g., smartphone camera).  
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous and adaptive (e.g., robot vacuum).

 **Traditional AI**, **Compound AI**, and **Agentic AI**:

---

### **1. Traditional AI**  
- **Example**: A **calculator**.  
  - It performs one task: solving math problems like addition or subtraction.

---

### **2. Compound AI**  
- **Example**: A **smartphone camera**.  
  - Combines face detection, object recognition, and image enhancement systems to produce better photos.

---

### **3. Agentic AI**  
- **Example**: A **robot vacuum**.  
  - It decides where to clean, avoids obstacles, and adjusts based on room layout, all autonomously.

**All Agentic AI systems are Compound AI, but not all Compound AI systems are Agentic AI. Compound AI becomes Agentic AI when it incorporates autonomy, interaction, and adaptability, transforming it from a static, rule-based collaboration into a dynamic, self-driven system.**

Imagine you have a robot friend that can help you with different things. But the robot doesn't know exactly what you want unless you tell it clearly.

**Prompt engineering** is like telling your robot friend exactly what you want in a way it can understand, so it gives you the best answer or helps you in the right way. 

Now, let's talk about how it works for two different kinds of robots:

1. **Generative AI Robots**:
   - These robots make things, like pictures or stories, from scratch. To get a good picture or story, you need to ask the robot clearly. For example, "Can you make a picture of a big purple dinosaur eating ice cream?"
   - So, **prompt engineering** for this robot means asking clear questions to get the right creation.

2. **Agentic AI Robots**:
   - These robots can make their own decisions and do things for you, like planning what to do today or solving a puzzle. You don't just ask for pictures or stories. Instead, you might say, "Please plan my day with fun activities."
   - Here, **prompt engineering** helps you give the robot clear directions so it knows how to make good decisions and help you.

So, **prompt engineering** is just a fancy way of saying, "Tell your robot friend exactly what you want, so it can help you best!"
