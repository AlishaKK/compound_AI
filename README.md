# compound_AI
Traditional AI is task-focused and single-purpose, while Compound AI is multi-faceted, collaborative, and adaptable.
Compound AI is particularly useful in Agentic AI, where multiple agents work together dynamically to handle complex and ever-changing environments.

- **Traditional AI**: Single task (e.g., calculator).  
- **Compound AI**: Multiple systems for one goal (e.g., smartphone camera).  
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous and adaptive (e.g., robot vacuum).

 **Traditional AI**, **Compound AI**, and **Agentic AI**:

---

### **1. Traditional AI**  
- **Example**: A **calculator**.  
  - It performs one task: solving math problems like addition or subtraction.

---

### **2. Compound AI**  
- **Example**: A **smartphone camera**.  
  - Combines face detection, object recognition, and image enhancement systems to produce better photos.

---

### **3. Agentic AI**  
- **Example**: A **robot vacuum**.  
  - It decides where to clean, avoids obstacles, and adjusts based on room layout, all autonomously.

**All Agentic AI systems are Compound AI, but not all Compound AI systems are Agentic AI. Compound AI becomes Agentic AI when it incorporates autonomy, interaction, and adaptability, transforming it from a static, rule-based collaboration into a dynamic, self-driven system.**
