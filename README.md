# compound_AI
Traditional AI is task-focused and single-purpose, while Compound AI is multi-faceted, collaborative, and adaptable.
Compound AI is particularly useful in Agentic AI, where multiple agents work together dynamically to handle complex and ever-changing environments.

- **Traditional AI**: Single task (e.g., calculator).  
- **Compound AI**: Multiple systems for one goal (e.g., smartphone camera).  
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous and adaptive (e.g., robot vacuum).

**All Agentic AI systems are Compound AI, but not all Compound AI systems are Agentic AI. Compound AI becomes Agentic AI when it incorporates autonomy, interaction, and adaptability, transforming it from a static, rule-based collaboration into a dynamic, self-driven system.**
